   Unfortunately we did not manage to catch all of them, not by a long shot. Their escort pulled some impressive maneuvers and I'm starting to understand why we had so much trouble catching them. They are so fast no convoy could ever escape them. Not very sturdy though. Since most of the light freighters managed to jump in I am sure they know we are coming. We cannot allow them time to organize a serious defence. We are just getting some emergency repairs done and we jump immediately and blind, but in force, all weapons hot and ready for anything.
