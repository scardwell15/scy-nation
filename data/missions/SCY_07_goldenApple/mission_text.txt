Personal journal
   The routine is sinking in. I change fleets on the fly and it no longer bothers me at all. Actually I'm quite enjoying it! I virtually captain some of the best ships in the sector: most of the time I am kicking rookies butts, and if I fail, I don't get blamed for my failure. Seriously, this is a vacation compared to when we were in the regular military. Later today I will be flying a Hyperion-class! The vaunted top of the line frigate class and pride of Tri-Tachyon Corporation.

   Orson team got beaten badly during this exercise against our former Blue team. That is strange as I was sure he had a Tri-Tachyion military background. Al said he was even more taciturn than usual, if that is even possible... Well possibly we screwed up the design of the exercise, or he just got caught on a bad day. Let us see how we do before drawing any conclusions, but I would love to get better results than him for once! The man is a machine, never making a mistake, always exploiting every opportunity.
