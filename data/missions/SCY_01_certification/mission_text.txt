CMD Morgan Kahl, to Candidates for Full Citizenship

   Morning candidate,

   Today with six other volunteers you will take the final certification test for captaincy in the Navy. This is the first time in our history that we might accept former indentured miners into our ranks; you may have noticed some anxiety about your former allegiance. All personnel have been extensively briefed of our goal: to make certain you all feel that you belong.

   While you will remain under observation for the coming months, your movements will not be hindered in any fashion. You will receive the same benefits, rights and duties as every other officer and member of our nation, and are expected to report any unsuitable comportment from your comrades should they forget that particular point. 

   Good Luck out there,

   CMD M. Khal
