Personal journal
   Bad news, we have been pulled from our training groups. Good news, we are fighting them! In simulations of course. The Admiralty, in their infinite wisdom decided that since we know the tactics of the enemy, we would be of better use as commanders of the opposing ships during exercises. As of today we are part of the Red Squadron. I'll probably miss being captain of an actual ship (while trainee ships fly for real during exercises, the adversary is only computer generated) but the warm welcome from the rest of the squadron was truly refreshing. It feels good to see our skills not only acknowledged, but also valued. They already asked us to participate in the collaboration for the next series of exercises.

   And for the first time, I get to command a Conquest-class, now that will be interesting!

   We are closing in on Tartarus, I never get tired of the constant movements in its atmosphere. The glow that comes from inside gives it almost an organic look, it is very relaxing to watch.
