Location: Mining Outpost; Low Orbit
Date: Cycle 204, day 195

Personal journal
   Today I understood what Matel meant when we spoke after the Apple Tree exercise. He opened up a bit, saying that it was weird for him to face his former nation, even in a simulation. But so much time has passed since he was captured, and he had time to reflect upon the Hegemony. I was not aware of this, but in the first years he was often mistreated by people that were suffering from their rule. This made him think, if he was surprised at first, he does not mind facing the Hegemony anymore

   Well it is my turn now: exercise Garden Party (what is with these food names???) and we face Coalition Forces. Being in orbit of the Mining Outpost does not help either, we spent years on that rock. Our orbit is so low I can see the "Big Hole" mine and the starport.

   I'm teamed up with Matel, we are respectively seconded by Lea and Michel (those two won't have to face their own people: Agria has no fleet worth mentioning). Orson, Nadia and Al already finished the exercise, apparently their group did well. I was a bit surprised when they separated us seven, but I guess the admiralty wanted us to share our experience with as many cadets as possible.
