205.175.9
   The Skoll did not allow us catch a breath. After their well executed ambush they quickly gathered their forces and are now coming to finish the job. While I am confident that Commodore A'Holia will try her best to cover their escape, I'm worried about the civilian ships. 

   What, and who we could salvage from the wrecks are on board these two ships and they MUST be allowed to escape. This is the first time we got our hands on solid data and even some of their hardware and it is imperative that they get back to HQ intact. I say them but I should say we: the Commodore ordered my transfer to the Optimum since I'm not really needed on the Vigor anymore, and it is unlikely it will ever get home again.
