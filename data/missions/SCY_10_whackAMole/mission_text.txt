Personal Journal

   Orson a traitor? I would never have saw that coming! We all are a bit in shock here, especially Nadia that apparently had a relationship with him, but there is no time to grief or think. Before jumping in his frigate, Orson managed to sabotage one of the Balius freighters. The explosion crippled the other one and the troop transport: 300 people are now stuck here. If that was not somehow enough, he also managed to send out a signal before fleeing. Now we have to intercept anyone in the region that could have received it.

   This is bad since our ships are already late for revision, and there are multiple targets to intercept as soon as possible. The 14th recon division has been tasked to catch two convoys that changed course to investigate the signal. The 15th is gone to take on an anti-pirate patrol (the kind of force we usually avoid at all costs). And the 4th recon is changing course to capture a small listening post. We must not let anyone escape and report our position, at least until the station can be evacuated. The commander divided our force in two, and I received the smaller one to deal with one of the convoys. Matel has been transferred to the 15th to replace Orson. I hope everyone will get back.
