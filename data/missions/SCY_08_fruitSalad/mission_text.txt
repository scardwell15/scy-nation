Personal journal
   Ugh, we are back with the regulars. These past months have been the best yet, but I guess everything has an end. Also, we are about to be integrated into active corps. We are now on our way to Deep Space Outpost 045, with technicians and crews to relieve the scout squadrons. I guess this is it, after the capture, seven years in the mines, the transfer to Phoenix, the Officers School accelerated program, the certificate, the active formation, and the Red Squadron, we are about to take up arms against the rest of the sector. And it feels good! That must say a lot about the opinion we now have about our former governments/CEOs/councils/whatever.

   It is a six month long assignment, I was lucky I could spend a few days off to see my child.

   The commander of the convoy decided he wanted to make sure we will not embarrass him when we arrive at the station. He organized a last batch of exercises right here in the middle of nowhere between us new recruits. Everyone is eager to prove his worth one last time as it might cement the opinion our future superiors officers have about us.
