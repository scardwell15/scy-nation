flavorTextMarketHepaistos,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$id == SCY_hephaistosStation score:1000","AddText""The concourse is surprisingly vast but the immense majority of the parked ships wear Scyan colors. Strangers are required to dock in a small dedicated area: as soon as a captain emerges out of the airlock of his ship he is coldly greeted by a port officer and his escort. They do not try to conceal the fact that they are here to watch over his every move. All of them have a radiation dosage detector clipped to their belt, as does everyone else around. As a matter of fact, they do not look like the healthiest bunch. Strangers are advised to limit the duration of their stay to a minimum.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketElysee,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$id == TAR_elysee score:1000","AddText""Walking out from your shuttle you notice your pilot wiping sweat from their forehead. While the orbital descent went swimingly well, the final approach of the spaceport directly cut into the face of continental cliff amids chaotic crosswinds took a toll on every passenger. That alone could explain the reduced immigration to Elysee. Once the border customs are cleared however, you find an almost disapointingly familiar underground settlement. While the living standard seems quite comfortable juging by the modern implants and latest tri-pads commonly seen, the sheer density of the omnipresent crowd makes you regret leaving your flagship. And here you thought years in the confines of metal boxes had vaccinated you against any agoraphobia.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketOutpost,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$id == TAR_mine score:1000","AddText""You don't even need to exit your shuttle to know you will not enjoy your stay on this colony. Industrial settlement through and through, little is made to accomodate visitors, especially given the history of the place. Giant loading machines move around the vast concrete disk of the spaceport like strange insects on a plate. Workers in heavy protecting gear move in and out mine-shaft elevators directly from and to the nearest tavern, or nearest brothel depending on the number of times they narowly escaped death this day. Every time you feel tremors from the ground you wonder if it a controlled explosion or a collapsing gallery.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketOverwatch,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$id == SCY_overwatchStation score:1000","AddText""The docking area is not that large but at the same time maintains a substantial level of traffic. While the rhythm has slowed down some since the peace treaty was signed and the reduction in the military needs for new ships, the increased exportations keep the station alive and busy. There is always at least one freighter getting loaded in a steady ballet of lights and workers, cadenced by the blaring of the ship arrival alarm. As it is a military structure, there is a disproportionate amount of guard always on duty. While the floor and machinery show clear signs of intense usage, it remains surprisingly spotless for a dockyard.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketRefinery,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$id == SCY_refinery score:1000","AddText""The concourse lies in the shadow cast by the immense shield that protects the whole station. Breather masks are provided free of charge to keep the reaking of ozone at bay, as well as radiation detectors. Lined up on the wall are three dozen large, bulky, golden exoskeletons being inspected and patched up before the shield requires new repairs. It appears they are made of the same heat-resistant material that is used for atmospheric re-entry vehicles. The helmet of one of the suits has visibly melted from the inside and is being replaced.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketProcessing,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$id == SCY_processing score:1000","AddText""While the exterior space is uniformly grey due to the ring's dust, even dimming Tartarus' light, the concourse is bright and colourful. The workers here seems relaxed and happier than most. The customs officers are polite, friendly even and encourage newcomers to visit the station. In the main hall, an open caf? is releasing a tantalizing spicy smell. Inside, a man catches the small cylindrical container the bartender just sold him, and goes to isolate himself in a curtained alcove.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketConditioning,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$id == SCY_conditioning score:1000","AddText""The cold and gloomy concourse is in harmony with the surrounding area: Tartarus is but a point lost in the dark nebular backdrop, and the ice planet bellow seems to have deprived the workers from all their morale. Few ships ever visit this forsaken place, and if it was not for the vital need of its produced volatiles, the station surely would have been abandoned long ago. The automated ice collectors, and the rumbling of the massive boilers bring a bit of life to this otherwise still painting.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketPrismFreeport,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$id == SCY_amityFreeport score:1000","AddText""If the visual cacophony of modules didn't gave it away from space already, a single glance to the station's map would reveal its recent explosive growth, and the lack of city planning therein. Fortunately for the impromptu visitor, directions to main attraction of the station, and the reason for the buzzing activity all around you, is clearly and unmistakably indicated: Large holo panels as well as ground marking are all herding any and all potential customers toward the Ship and Weapon Show. Hordes of buyers, sellers, hecklers, and the occasional black-market smuggler, gather there to perform a terrifying ballet of interjections, barters and transactions. It is said that the Show never sleeps, and given this spectacle it sure seems like it.""textGrayColor",,,
flavorTextMarketChaosHideout,TradePanelFlavorText,"$global.tradePanelMode == MARKET
$id == SCY_piratePort score:1000","AddText""Almost deserted, the large concourse appears to be on the brink of collapsing. The rest of the station does nothing to change that feeling as half the modules are either abandoned, or never were finished. Someone even managed to stole a whole corridor section for spare parts that was never replaced! The black market is not worth mentioning either, everyone has already left and the stocks are barely more than scraps. The Underdogs pub is airing some classic Psycho-Renaissance jazz that could wake up a corpse. Not that it seems effective on the few comatose patrons.""textGrayColor",,,
